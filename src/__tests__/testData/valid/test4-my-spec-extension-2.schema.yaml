    description: |-
      The property defines how value helps for this element shall be constructed.

      It allows to associate a (set of) View/Entity that provides the "Value Help" for the annotated field or parameter.
      This is achieved by either referencing the target view/entity of a modelled association or by directly establishing a relationship to view/entity that shall act as a value help provider.

        description:
          Reference to the modelled association (in local entity) for which the target view represents the value help providing view or entity for the annotated local field.
          The on-condition of the association may only contain bindings of the source and target fields that use an equal operator.
          All these bindings are automatically considered by the value help for both filter and result mappings.

          Mutually exclusive to the usage of `valueHelpDefinition.entity`.
      distinctValues:
        type: boolean
        description: |-
          Specifies whether the value help result list shall only contain distinct values for the annotated field or parameter.
          If set to true all mappings will be used for filtering, but only the value for the field/parameter which the value help was requested for will be returned by the value help.
        default: true
    additionalProperties: false
    examples:
      - { "entity": { "name": "I_ControllingAreaStdVH", "element": "ControllingArea" } }

      element:

  "@Consumption.ConsumptionValueHelpDefinition.AdditionalBinding":
    title: Additional Binding
    description: |-
      Allows to define additional bindings (besides the ones defined by `valueHelpDefinition.association` or `valueHelpDefinition.entity`) for filtering the value help result list and/or returning values from the selected value help record.
    type: object
    properties:
      localElement:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Field of the current view/entity; mutually exclusive to the usage of `localParameter`.
      element:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Name of the field of the value help view or entity, which the annotated local field or parameter is bound to.

    description: |-
      The binding may either specify an additional filter-criterion on the value help list (`#FILTER`), or an additional result mapping for the selected value help record (`#RESULT`) or a combination thereof (`#FILTER_AND_RESULT`).
      If not specified explicitly the usage is `#FILTER_AND_RESULT`.
      If distinctValues is set to true, additional bindings must specify the usage as `#FILTER`.
    properties:
      "#":

          Provide the value in `{ "#": "<value>" }` enum notation.
