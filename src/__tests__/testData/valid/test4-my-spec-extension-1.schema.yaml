description: This is the interface description of @Annotation.
type: object
definitions:
  "@Aggregation.default":
    description: |-
      The element shall per default be aggregated using the annotated SQL aggregate function.

      The chosen value defines which aggregation semantics should be applied.
      The aggregation types SUM, MAX, MIN, NOP are only allowed for elements with numeric type

      > ℹ️ Note: There is an semantically equivalent annotation `@DefaultAggregation`, which is now obsolete.
      > As consumers are not expected to interpret `@DefaultAggregation`, providers shall consistently adopt `@Aggregation.default` for interoperability.

              Indicates that the element is not a measure.
              Usually these elements are used in filters and GROUP BY-statements. Should not be used explicit.
              It is the default for all elements which can be mapped to a dimension.

              Correspond to the standard SQL aggregation type.
          - const: "MIN"
            description: |-
              Correspond to the standard SQL aggregation type.
          - const: "MAX"
            description: |-
              Correspond to the standard SQL aggregation type.

            description: |-
              Correspond to the standard SQL aggregation type.
          - const: "COUNT_DISTINCT"
            description: |-
              Counts the number of distinct values of the element specified with `@Aggregation.referenceElement`.

              > TODO: `@Aggregation.referenceElement` is not yet documented here.
          - const: "NOP"
            description: |-
              Returns a value, if it is unique; otherwise it returns a special error value. It is the default in views with Analytics.dataCategory CUBE, FACT, and DIMENSION, if the data type of the element is numeric.
          - const: "FORMULA"
            description: |-
              The element is a formula which has to be calculated after the operands have been determined by aggregation or calculation. It should never be aggregated. If the element is not a formula, then this value must not be used. It is only supported in analytical queries. Example: Margin : = Revenue / Cost. If in a report Margin should be shown per OrgUnit, then first the aggregates of Revenue and Cost have to be de-termined per OrgUnit and then the Margin has to be calculated per OrgUn-it. The Margin for the company is not the aggregate of the Margin per Or-gUnit but has to be calculated separately by Revenue for all OrgUnits divided by the Costs for all OrgUnits.
